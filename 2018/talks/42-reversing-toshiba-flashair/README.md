Reversing a Japanese Wireless SD Card With r2 (@guedou)

Toshiba FlashAir are wireless SD cards used by photographers and IoT
enthusiasts. They integrate both a Japanese SoC, Toshiba MeP, and a Japanese
Operating System, UDEOS4 from the TRON family.  This talk presents
investigations that lead to the discovery of the architecture and the operating
system from nearly zero knowledge of the card.  These investigations were
performed with open-source tools only: miasm2 is used as the assembly,
disassembly and emulation backend, while radare2 is used as the interface to
reverse the firmware.
